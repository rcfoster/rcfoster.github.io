              <h2>About Robert</h2>
              <br/>
                <p>Hi! I'm Robert. I'm currently a scientist at Bettis atomic power laboratory in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania..</p>
		<p>I graduated with a PhD in statistics from Iowa State University.</p>
		<p>I do research in statistics. I just enjoy playing around with new technologies and looking for new and interesting ways to do things. I think Bayesian and frequentist methodologies are much more closely related than people realize, and I'm a big fan of the exponential family.</p>
