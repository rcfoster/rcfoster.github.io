%         PAPER SIZE, PAGE NUMBER, AND DOCUMENT LAYOUT NOTES:
%
% The next \usepackage line changes the layout for CV style section
% headings as marginal notes. It also sets up the paper size as either
% letter or A4. By default, letter was used. If A4 paper is desired,
% comment out the letterpaper lines and uncomment the a4paper lines.
%
% As you can see, the margin widths and section title widths can be
% easily adjusted.
%
% ALSO: Notice that the includefoot option can be commented OUT in order
% to put the PAGE NUMBER *IN* the bottom margin. This will make the
% effective text area larger.
%
% IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE THE ``of LASTPAGE'' next to each page number,
% see the note about the +LP and -LP lines below. Comment out the +LP
% and uncomment the -LP.
%
% IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE PAGE NUMBERS, be sure that the includefoot line
% is uncommented and ALSO uncomment the \pagestyle{empty} a few lines
% below.

             	\item Thesis title: Topics in Empirical Bayesian Analysis
		\item Adviser: Mark S. Kaiser
		\item 3.65 GPA
		\item The primary focus of my dissertation was on comparing and contrasting the ways that the uncertainty introduced from double use  of the data (once for estimation of the hyperparameters, once in the resulting Bayesian analysis) has been accounted for, and incorporating many of these methods into a consistent framework. A new method was proposed for deriving empirical Bayesian intervals for means of natural exponential families with quadratic variance functions based on a modified version of intervals previously described by Carl Morris.\\
