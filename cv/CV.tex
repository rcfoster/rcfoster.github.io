%         PAPER SIZE, PAGE NUMBER, AND DOCUMENT LAYOUT NOTES:
%
% The next \usepackage line changes the layout for CV style section

% letter or A4. By default, letter was used. If A4 paper is desired,
% comment out the letterpaper lines and uncomment the a4paper lines.
%
% As you can see, the margin widths and section title widths can be
% easily adjusted.
%
% ALSO: Notice that the includefoot option can be commented OUT in order
% to put the PAGE NUMBER *IN* the bottom margin. This will make the
% effective text area larger.
%
% IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE THE ``of LASTPAGE'' next to each page number,
% see the note about the +LP and -LP lines below. Comment out the +LP
% and uncomment the -LP.

% is uncommented and ALSO uncomment the \pagestyle{empty} a few lines
% below.

\textbf{Ph.D. in Statistics}

             	\item Thesis title: \href{https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/etd/15910/}{Topics in Empirical Bayesian Analysis}
		\item Adviser: Mark S. Kaiser
		\item 3.65 GPA
		%\item My dissertation focuses on comparing and contrasting the ways that the uncertainty introduced into empirical Bayesian methods from double use of the data (once for estimation of the hyperparameters, once in the resulting Bayesian analysis) has been accounted for. Several of these disparate methods are combined into one consistent framework. A new method is proposed for deriving empirical Bayesian intervals for means of natural exponential families with quadratic variance functions based on a modified method of Carl Morris.\\

		\item Adviser: Alyson Wilson
		\item 3.65 GPA
		%\item My thesis analyzes a Bayesian method for obtaining a sequential test plan based on a specific type of data and determines how the estimated test plan is affected by choice of the prior distribution on the parameters. The performance of the estimated test plan under model misspecification is also investigated.
