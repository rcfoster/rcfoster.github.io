I enjoy traveling to watch baseball games. In grad school, I briefly had a baseball statistics blog that I wrote (partly for fun, partly as an application to work through problems that ended up in my thesis). [Check it out!](http://www.probabilaball.com) The main topic I wrote on was the underlying theory of stabilization points.
