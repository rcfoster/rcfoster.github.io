I do research in psychometrics for fun after work and on weekends when I have free time. I've done research primarily on reliability for test data that comes from non-normal exponential family data distributions, especially with conjugate priors. You can see my published papers on [my CV](https://rcfoster.github.io/cv/CV.pdf) or [my Google scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Jn_dd0UAAAAJ).

I also enjoy watching baseball games. In grad school, I briefly had a baseball statistics blog that I wrote (partly for fun, partly as an application to work through problems that ended up in my thesis). [Check it out!](http://www.probabilaball.com) The main topic I wrote on was the underlying theory of stabilization points.
