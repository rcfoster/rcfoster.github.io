I enjoy exploring and seeing new things around Pittsburgh, hiking the beautiful Western Pennsylvania area, gaming, and visiting new cities when I can.

I've been playing the guitar since I was 20 years old. While in graduate school, I took lessons and performed in local musical productions. I enjoy playing mostly rock and blues.

I also enjoy reading, with my primary interest in history (including the history of statistics). You can see what I'm currently reading [on my goodreads account](https://www.goodreads.com/rcfoster).
