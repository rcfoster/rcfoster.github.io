In my free time, I enjoy exploring the beautiful New Mexico area, visiting new cities, and hiking the trails around Los Alamos. 

I've been playing the guitar since I was 20 years old. While in graduate school, I took lessons and performed in local musical productions. I enjoy playing mostly rock and blues.

I also enjoy reading, with my primary interest in history (including the history of statistics). You can see what I'm currently reading [on my goodreads account](https://www.goodreads.com/rcfoster).
