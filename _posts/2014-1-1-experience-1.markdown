I work as a statistician for Bettis atomic power laboratory, providing the Navy with statistical support for the reactors powering their ships. I consult on topics throughout the lab, ranging from materials science to survey design, and I teach courses on various statistics topics. I previously completed a postdoctoral position at Los Alamos National Laboratory, during which I conducted research into errors in probabilistic computing, materials science, and applications of quantum computing in statistics.
