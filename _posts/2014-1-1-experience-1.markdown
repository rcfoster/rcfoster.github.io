I work as a statistician for Bettis atomic power laboratory, providing the Navy with statistical support for the reactors powering their ships. I previously completed a postdoctoral position at Los Alamos National Laboratory, during which I conducted research into errors in probabilistic computing, materials science, and applications of quantum computing in statistics. In my free time I enjoy doing research in topics that interest me such as psychometrics and exponential family theory.
