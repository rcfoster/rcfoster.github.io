I work as a statistician for Bettis atomic power laboratory, providing the Navy with statistical support for its reactors. I previously completed a postdoctoral position at Los Alamos National Laboratory, during which I conducted research into applications of quantum computing in statistics. As a hobby, I do some research in psychometrics.
